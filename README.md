# Linear-Binary-Search
Objective:
By completing this assignment, you will understand and implement Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms. You will analyze their efficiency and apply them to real-world scenarios.

Part 1: Linear Search (O(n)) \
Task 1: Implement Linear Search \
Write a Python function to perform Linear Search on a list. The function should:Â \
âœ… Take a list of numbers and a target value as input. \
âœ… Return the index of the target value if found, otherwise return -1.

Example Input & Output:

python \
CopyEdit \
arr = [10, 23, 45, 70, 11, 15] \
target = 70 \
âœ… Output: Element found at index 3

ðŸ‘‰ Write your function in Python and test it with different inputs.

Task 2: Time Complexity Analysis \
How many comparisons are made in the best case, worst case, and average case?
Why is Linear Search not the best choice for large datasets? \
ðŸ“Œ Hint: Consider how long it takes to search in a list of 1,000,000 elements!

Part 2: Binary Search (O(log n)) \
Task 3: Implement Binary Search \
Write a Python function to perform Binary Search on a sorted list. The function should: \
âœ… Take a sorted list of numbers and a target value as input. \
âœ… Use the divide and conquer approach. \
âœ… Return the index of the target value if found, otherwise return -1.

Example Input & Output:

python \
CopyEdit \
arr = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35] \
target = 25 \
âœ… Output: Element found at index 4 \

ðŸ‘‰ Implement both iterative and recursive versions of Binary Search.

Task 4: Compare Linear vs. Binary Search \
Measure the execution time of Linear Search and Binary Search on a list of 10,000 elements.
Plot a graph of n vs. time taken for both algorithms.
Answer: When is Binary Search NOT better than Linear Search?
ðŸ“Œ Hint: What happens when the list is unsorted?

Bonus Challenge ðŸŽ¯
ðŸ”¹ Modify Binary Search to return the number of steps it takes to find the element.
ðŸ”¹ Modify Linear Search to work with a list of strings instead of numbers.
